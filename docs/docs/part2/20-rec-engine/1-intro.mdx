# ðŸ“˜ Recommendation Engines

## Why Semantic Search?

Semantic search can be a powerful and simple solution for recommendation engines. The ability to search for similar products based on a number of attributes (essentially whatever content you pass to the LLM to generate embeddings) can give you a flexible way to
identify products with similar characteristics.

Combined with the `filter` statement to check for operational data (like inventory levels or availability) can greatly simplify the process of identifying replacement items to recommend to customers.

In this section we will implement a feature so that when viewing details of a specific book, the app will recommend other similar books.
