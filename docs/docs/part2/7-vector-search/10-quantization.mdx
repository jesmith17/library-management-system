# ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Vector quantization

Vector quantization is a technique to reduce the number of bits required to represent a vector. This can help vastly improve vector search performance.

However, before you enable quantization, note the current vector search index size. You may do so via the Atlas UI.

## Enabling quantization

To enable vector auto-quantization on your embeddings, simply set the `quantization` field to one of the supported quantization types (`scalar` or `binary`) in the vector search index definition.

You can edit your vector search index definition to the following:

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "numDimensions": 1408,
      "path": "embeddings",
      "quantization": "scalar",
      "similarity": "cosine",
      "type": "vector"
    }
    //...
  ]
}
```

:::info
Notice the slight increase in the size of the vector search index upon enabling automatic-quantization. This is because full-fidelity vectors are also stored on disk for re-scoring and/or exact nearest neighbors (ENN) search.

In the Atlas UI, the entire index size is displayed, which might be larger than the original index size, since Atlas does not show a break down of the data structures within an index that are stored in RAM and on disk.

The Atlas Search metrics however will show a much smaller index that is held in memory when you enable automatic quantization. Refer to our [documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/deployment-options/#storage-requirements-for-vectors) to learn more about these considerations.

If storage and index size is a concern, you may also consider [pre-quantized vectors](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-quantization/#how-to-ingest-pre-quantized-vectors).
