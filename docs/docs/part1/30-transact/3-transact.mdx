# üëê Understanding Transactions

One of the most critical things a DB can do is keep data accurate. In most systems this is done by managing the ACID properties of data changes (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable).

Open the `server/src/controllers/reivews.ts` file, and look for the `createReview()` method.

Notice that the `createReview()` method is doing 2 different operations inside the method

- Inserting a new `Review` document in to the `reviews` collection
- Adding that most recent review to the `book` document to add with fast retrieval (We review this in the previous section)

But what happens to the `review` that gest inserted if the update to the `books`collection fails?

Lets implement a `transaction` to ensure that these entries are done in an Atomic fashion

```ts showLineNumbers
    public async createReview(bookId: string, reviewBody: { text: string; rating: number; }, userName: string): Promise<{ insertResult: InsertOneResult, updateResult: UpdateResult }> {
        const session = clients?.client.startSession();
        let insertResult: InsertOneResult;
        let updateResult: UpdateResult;
        try {
            session.startTransaction()
            const review = {
                _id: null,
                text: reviewBody?.text,
                name: userName,
                rating: reviewBody?.rating,
                timestamp: (new Date()).getTime(),
                bookId
            } as Review;

            insertResult = await collections?.reviews?.insertOne(review);

            review._id = insertResult?.insertedId;
            delete review.bookId;

            updateResult = await collections?.books?.updateOne({_id: bookId}, {
                $push: {
                    reviews: {
                        $each: [review],
                        $sort: {timestamp: -1},
                        $slice: 5
                    }
                }
            });
            await session.commitTransaction();
        } catch (err) {
            await session.abortTransaction();
        } finally {
            await session.endSession();
        }
        return { insertResult, updateResult };`
    }

```

    Pay special attention to the code at lines 2-6 & 30-35 as those lines contain the changes needed to make this code transcational
