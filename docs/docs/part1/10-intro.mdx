# Lab 1: MongoDB Basics & Search

This lab will introduce you to the key concepts of working with data in MongoDB using the framework of our Library Management App.
All of the code that the lab will be working with is found in the `server` folder inside the code repository. The `client` folder contains the
code for the front-end application, but we will not be making any changes to that in these labs.


## Key Concepts

* Query for records
* Update Records
* Implement Transactions
* Utilize Atlas Search
