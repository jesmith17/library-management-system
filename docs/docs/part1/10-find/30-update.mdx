# üëê Update Reservations

One of the key features of the Library system is te ability to reserve books. When a given book is reserved, we need to make sure the inventory count for that book is updated so that we don't allow too many
reservations.

Lets spend some time updating the books `inventory` attribute to support that requirement.

Open the `server/src/controllers/books.ts` file, and look for the `updateBookInventory` method. What code do we need to add to make this method correct?

Lets review the options that exist.

MongoDB offers 3 options to update a document
- updateOne - Updates a single record based on the matching criteria provided
- updateMany - Updates all documents that match provided criteria
- replaceOne - Replaces a single document with the provided data based on match criteria

:::tip
Details for these oeprators can be found [Update Documents](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/crud/update/)
:::

Both of these methods take 2 documents as their input params.

```
db.collection.updateOne({ ... matching criteria ...}, { ... commands for updates to apply ...});
```

Using this guidance, lets update the above method with the correct context to adjust the `available` attribute to reflect that a copy has been reserved.

:::caution
Use `replace` carefully as it can create problems, especially in highly concurrent systems.

<div>

```ts
    private updateBookInventory(bookId: string, count: number): Promise<UpdateResult> {
        const result = collections?.books?.updateOne(
            { _id: bookId },
            { $inc: { available: count } }
        );
        return result;
    }

```

    Notice that the code is using the `$inc` operator to increment the `available` attribute by the amount provided.

:::tip
Mongo does not offer a decrement operator, but passing a negative value produces the same effect.
