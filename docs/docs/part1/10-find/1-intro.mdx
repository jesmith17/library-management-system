# ðŸ“˜ Intro

In this lesson you will implement some basic MongoDB functions to query the DB, and update records.

The purpose is to give you practical experience with the `find()` and `updateOne()` methods.

While this lesson does not cover all methods, the patterns learned in this section can be extended to other operators and behaviors.

If you haven't followed the session with us, we recommend that you go through the [Data Modeling course](https://learn.mongodb.com/learning-paths/data-modeling-for-mongodb) on MongoDB University before attempting this exercise.
