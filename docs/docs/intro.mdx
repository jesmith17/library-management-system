# üìò Intro

Welcome to the 2 part Hands-On Lab series on MongoDB. Over the course of the series users will get experience in 

* Performing Queries, Updates, and Inserts in MongoDB. 
* Optimize operations and data models to maximize the benefits of MongoDB. 
* Leverage MongoDB Atlas Search for lexical search support 
* Implement a recommendation engine using vector search from MongoDB Atlas. 

These labs are meant to be presented by one of our amazing instructors, but you can also do them on your own.

In the navigation bar, you will notice some icons. Here are their meanings:

## Concept

This hands-on lab has been created as a 2 part session.

### Part 1: MongoDB Basics & Search
Part 1 focuses on core MongoDB fundamentals and is done alongside a instructor led slide presentation to cover the concepts that features that set MongoDB apart from other DB platforms that you have used.
You will get an opportunity to directly implement some key code features and leverage other existing examples to provide a good reference on how to get started working with MongoDB.

### Part 2: Vectors & AI
With Part 2 you will dive into more advanced topics as we introduce semantic search and AI topics by leveraging MongoDB's vector search support. Working to build out more powerful searches in the Library app as well as a recommendation
engine, you will get the chance to implement these new features is key ways to help understand the power of vectors, and the advantage you can get with MongoDB.


The content in this lab is intended to be used during our live sessions, but you are welcome to use the content and work at your own pace. Each section has concepts to introduce the topic, links to key documentation, and code examples to help ensure your success
in being able to implement the concept and understand the material.



## Getting Started

To ensure that you get the most hands-on time during the live sessions, we recommend completing the steps in ***Lab Setup*** before the enablement sessions begin. The setup process should only take about 15 minutes, and will help ensure that you have a
great experience on the event day.
